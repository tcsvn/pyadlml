Activities of Daily living (ADLs) such as eating, working, sleeping and Smart Home device readings are recorded by inhabitants. Predicting resident activities based on the device event-stream allows for a range of applications, including automation, action recommendation and abnormal activity detection in the context of assisted living for elderly inhabitants. Pyadlml offers an easy way to fetch, visualize and preprocess common datasets.


## !! Disclaimer !!
Package is still an alpha-version and under active development. 
As of now do not expect anything to work! APIs are going to change, 
stuff breaks and the documentation may lack behind. Nevertheless, feel 
free to take a look. The safest point to start is probably the API reference.

## Last (stable) Release
```sh 
$ pip install pyadlml
```
## Latest Development Changes
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tcsvn/pyadlml
$ cd pyadlml
$ pip install .
```

## Usage example


### Simple

```python
# Fetch dataset
from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_amsterdam
data = fetch_amsterdam()
df_devs, df_acts = data['devices'], data['activities']


# Plot the residents activity density over one day
from pyadlml.plot import plot_activity_density
fig = plot_activity_density(df_acts)
fig.show()


# Create a vector representing the state of all Smart Home devices
# at a certain time and discretize the events into 20 second bins
from pyadlml.preprocessing import Event2Vec, LabelMatcher
e2v = Event2Vec(encode='state', dt='20s')
states = e2v.fit_transform(df_devs)

# Label each datum with the corresponding activity.
# When an event matches no activity set the activity to "other"
lbls = LabelMatcher(other=True).fit_transform(df_acts, states)

# Extract numpy arrays without timestamps (1st column)
X, y = states.values[:,1:], lbls.values[:,1:]

# Proceed with machine learning stuff 
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.score(X, y)
...
```

### Less simple


```python
from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_amsterdam
from pyadlml.constants import VALUE
from pyadlml.pipeline import Pipeline
from pyadlml.preprocessing import IndexEncoder, LabelMatcher, DropTimeIndex, \
                                  EventWindows, DropColumn
from pyadlml.model_selection import train_test_split
from pyadlml.model import DilatedModel
from pyadlml.dataset.torch import TorchDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torch.optim import Adam 
from torch.nn import functional as F

# Featch data and split into train/val/test based on time rather than #events
data = fetch_amsterdam()
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(
    data['devices'], data['activities'], \
    split=(0.6, 0.2, 0.2), temporal=True,
)

# Formulate all preprocessing steps using a sklearn styled pipeline 
pipe = Pipeline([
    ('enc', IndexEncoder()),            # Encode devices strings with indices
    ('drop_obs', DropColumn(VALUE)),    # Disregard device observations
    ('lbl', LabelMatcher(other=True)),  # Generate labels y  
    ('drop_time', DropTimeIndex()),     # Remove timestamps for x and y
    ('windows', EventWindows(           # Create sequences S with a sliding window
                  rep='many-to-one',    # Only one label y_i per sequence S_i
                  window_size=16,       # Each sequence contains 16 events 
                  stride=2)),           # A sequence is created every 2 events
    ('passthrough', 'passthrough')      # Do not use a classifier in the pipeline
])

# Create a dataset to sample from
dataset = TorchDataset(X_train, y_train, pipe) 
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
model = DilatedModel(
    n_features=14,       # Number of devices
    n_classes=8          # Number of activities
)
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

# Minimal loop to overfit the data
for s in range(10000):
    for (Xb, yb) in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        logits = model(Xb)
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, yb)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

...
```
